  "clean_description": "All of my weed is straight from a dispensary medical amazing quality. This strain is one of my all time favorites , originating in Denver and winner of the cannabis cup and voted high times best strain. The smoothness and smoke of this one tastes like a bowl of fruity pebbles and is extremely potent. One hitter shit. It wo nt be this price for long , it s still AAA grade but my dispensary has a surplus of it so i can offer this dank ass bud cheaper for a short while. Get it while it lasts.",
