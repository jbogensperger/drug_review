  "clean_description": "This Orange Krush. So named for it s orange hairs , and potency is a special raised Indica dominant. Catering to folks who enjoy more sensual , body highs. Ideal for pain management , relaxation , and to generally get totally stoned in a classic sense. This is the kind of Bud Led Zeppelin and Aerosmith dreamed on to when they wrote their hits , and now so can you. Pro - Grown , Hydro , tended to with the utmost care , Mental effects are positive and a little bit psychedelic. It s almost like this strain has something to it that could be compared to a swig of wine. Not alcoholic , but certainly somewhat intoxicating. Wonderful for experiencing the more body based phenomenon brought on by phenomenal weed. This strains genetic pedigree is praised far and wide , and with two decades of cropping applied to the awesome potential of Orange Krush , the result is astonishing. Beware the munchies with this strain. Come get Krushed.",
