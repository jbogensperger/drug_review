  "clean_description": "Kratom , Mitragynine Speciosa , Acts as a stimulant in small dosages , a sedative at higher doses. Generally brewed as a tea and has effects which last for around 6 - 7 hours. Add honey when making tea , as its quiet bitter. Tollerance does build up after a while , so infrequent usage is advised. It works on opiate receptors and has a similar effect to opiates , but is far less addictive - although does have some degree of post use pull. Green and white strains tend to be more stimulating , red strains more sedative. Perfect to make tea and veg to 3 movies an a good evening in , or take a small amount for stimulating properties and get on with your day.",
