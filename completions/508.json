  "clean_description": "This beautiful flower comes from the cross of Chemdawg and Northern Lights. Her heavy sativa hybrid nature gives off a level but very euphoric buzz , while a very mellow body buzz allows your strong mental motivation to carry you wherever you desire. After using this through college and having it help my rheumatoid arthritis , it is my opinion that this Diesel strain helps with anxiety , symptoms of insomnia it helps with relieving that tired feeling behind your eyes , stress and even chronic pain. I ve also heard of use for alleviating depressive moods and PTSD symptoms. updated images coming soon.",
